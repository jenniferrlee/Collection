        1. Describe the book in formal, factual terms: what is it about, what decisions did the designer or author make. <br>
        
        The book Supplemento al dizionario italiano by Bruno Munari is a book in which he explains the meaning of the 
        characteristic and deeply codified Italian hand gestures, many of which originated in Napoli before spreading 
        to the rest of Italy and in some cases the rest of the world. 
        The book is about the size of my hand, from the bottom of the palm to the tip of my middle finger in length.
        It is bound by PUR perfect binding method, making it easy to open the book in 180 degrees.
        In each body spread, the left page has the meanings explained in 4 different languages - Italian, French, English and German.
        The right page has a black and white image of the hand gesture that is being explained.

        2. Try to identify what *Gestalt* principles you see utilized in the book.<br>
        This book is consisted of a simle layout of a single column text on the left page, and an image on the right page. It makes the reader first read
        the meaning of thee gesture, which is intriguing and evokes curiosity.

        3. Write a conclusion with your overall impression and/or critique of the bookâ€™s design.<br>
        The book overvall is well-designed and very easy to read. The repetition of this layout throughout the whole book makes a strong structure
        of receiving textual content then an interesting visual content which may or may not match the readers' expectation. I also enjoyed the relatively
        heavy paper weight, as it created a sense of heaviness and seriousness which contradicts the humourous, satircal content in a way.
